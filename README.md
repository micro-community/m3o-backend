# Backend

This is the backend for the M3O Platform.

## Overview

This repository serves as the backend for the M3O platform and related services. These are services which power Micro as a Service and enable us 
to offer Micro Cloud. This includes things like customer management, billing, etc.

## Dependencies

We depend on Micro using the "platform" profile. It runs on kubernetes with the resources below:

- Etcd
- Redis
- Postgres

## Design

All services are Micro services written using the Micro framework without exception.

- Services speak to each other via RPC
- Messages are used for async eventing
- Infrastructure usage occurs only through Micro

## Events
All events should be defined in protobuf under `pkg/events/proto/<topic_name>`. The directory should contain the following files.
### `events.proto` 
This should define 
- `enum EventType` - enumerates all the event types available
- `message Event` - which should contain at least the field `EnumType type`. Any data specific to the event should be defined in separate fields in the `Event` message. You may also find it useful to have data that is common to all events in a common field. For example, the events on the `customers` stream have a `Customer` field which at a minimum contains the customer ID. The events then have event specific messages for any other data, e.g. the field `Created` contains data associated with the customer creation event.  
   
### `constants.go`
This file should define the topic name so that publishers/consumers can reference this const rather than hand coding the topic name (with the potential for errors). e.g. 

```
const Topic = "customers"
```

See existing directories for examples.

### Mixpanel
Events are forwarded to Mixpanel for analysis. Due to the way enum types are converted to their string representation we need to redeploy the Mixpanel service every time we add events otherwise they will get incorrectly reported.

## Naming

Directories are the domain boundary for a specific concern e.g user, account, payment. They act as the 
alias for the otherwise fully qualified domain name "go.micro.service.alias". Services should follow 
this naming convention and focus on single word naming where possible.

## Structure

Services should be generated using the `micro new` command using the alias e.g `micro new account`. 
The internal structure is defined by our new template generator. Extending this should follow 
a further convention as follows:

```
user/
    api/	# api spec
    web/	# web html
    client/	# generated clients
    service/	# core service types
    handler/	# request handlers
    subscriber/	# message subscribers
    proto/	# proto generated code
    main.go	# service main
    user.mu	# mu definition
    README.md	# readme
```

## Testing
We use https://github.com/maxbrunsfeld/counterfeiter for generating test doubles for our services. These can then be imported in to other tests and used instead of real implementations. 

We can then write tests which call the endpoints (contract testing) and verify that they do the right thing by checking call counts on the test doubles. 

By convention, we generate fakes in the same directory tree as for the real proto implementation. For example, customers service is defined at `customers/proto` so the test double is defined in `customers/proto/fakes`. 

Example generate command 
```
counterfeiter -o proto/fakes/fake_usage_service.go proto UsageService
```
